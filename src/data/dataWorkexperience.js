        As a Junior Software Developer at Digital Distribution Group, I worked on a variety of development tasks that enhanced both my technical skills and problem-solving abilities:
        -developed and maintained responsive, user-friendly web pages using HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Twig;
        -integrated both external and internal APIs into the companyâ€™s main project to enhance system capabilities;
        -designed and implemented new features to improve platform functionality and user experience;
        -created automation commands to optimize database and framework update processes, improving efficiency and reducing downtime;
        -worked on live production servers, ensuring stability, security, and smooth deployment;
        -managed and optimized relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases;
        -utilized PHP (Symfony), Doctrine, and Symfony Profiler for backend development and performance tuning;
        -employed tools and technologies including Jenkins, Redis, Node.js, Git, GitLab, TortoiseGit, Cloudflare, Postman, VS Code, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Asana, Slack, Figma, and Adobe Photoshop for development, version control, CI/CD, collaboration, and design.

        From this experience, I learned to work effectively in a production environment, collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, and apply best practices in both front-end and back-end development.

        As an Intern RPA Specialist at Automatify, I learned more about the following: 
        
        -process optimization and automation methods that help significantly in operational efficiency and productivity;
        -designing and developing methods for RPA bots to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks;
        -implemented exception handling mechanisms to ensure smooth bot operation and minimize manual intervention;
        -implemented automation of data extraction, analysis, and reporting, leading to significant time and cost savings.

        From the internship, I learned a lot of new information during the intern academy as well as the practice on the project.
        I created a project that, through transactional processes, extracts the information from the invoices received in outlook, then logs in to sharepoint and enters the data necessary taken from invoices. 
        I also applied the company's reframework on the same project.
