        As an Intern RPA Specialist at Automatify, I learned more about the following:
          -process optimization and automation methods that help significantly in operational efficiency and productivity;
          -designing and developing methods for RPA bots to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks;
          -implemented exception handling mechanisms to ensure smooth bot operation and minimize manual intervention;
          -implemented automation of data extraction, analysis, and reporting, leading to significant time and cost savings.

          After the internship, I learned a lot of new information during the academy from the internship as well as the practice on the project.
          I created a project that, through transactional processes, extracts the information from the invoices received in outlook, then logs in to sharepoint and enters the data necessary taken from invoices. 
          I also applied the company's reframework on the same project.
